# Colonel Blotto Game
Some code to get an intuition about Colonel Blotto game. Problem description below.

There are 10 castles, numbered 1, 2, 3, ... , 10, and worth 1, 2, 3, ... , 10 points respectively. You have
100 soldiers, which you can allocate between the castles however you wish. Your opponents also
(independently) do the same.

3 strikes, youâ€™re Out! Castles are fought in order from 1 to 10. The number of soldiers on each castle
is then compared, and for each castle, whoever has the most soldiers on that castle wins its points (in
the case of a tie, no one gets points). However, as soon as one player wins 3 consecutive castles,
they automatically win all the remaining Castles too.
